The scripts in this folder have the following purpose:
funcs.py - general functions useful for other scripts
load.py - functions for loading data
parameter_profile.py - This script calculates a profile of any parameter for an entire simulation
parameter_profile_whole_run.py - This script visualises a parameter through out a simulation that is binned along a particular axis. This is shown in form of a 3D graph and a heat map
single_snapshot.py - With this script can view different parameters of a single snapshot. Also calculates vorticity
coarsening_gradient.py - This script plots the behaviour of the average radius against scaled time for an arbitrary amount of simulations
