# TODO

## Samples
Define some samples:
- make a separate directory per sample
- input file(s) and sample outputs in directory

## Testing
1. Run some sample programs & save output
1. Add support for Gtest
1. Start moving code from kernels to device functions
1. Try to convert to device/host functions
1. Add tests for separated functions
1. While making changes, run sample tests and compare output

## SYCL
Conversion from CUDA to SYCL much easier, when main functionality in free functions.
